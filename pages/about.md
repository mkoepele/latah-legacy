## The Latah County Historical Society
The Latah County Historical Society's origins go back to the founding of the Latah County Pioneer Association in 1891, only 20 years after the first settlers had arrived in the area. As Mary Reed, former director of the Latah County Historical Society, writes in the Fall 1988 issue of Latah Legacy (Vol. 13, No. 3), "These people clearly recognized their own historic importance and that the events in which they had participated would never be repeated."

Just a few years later, a group of Moscow women formed the Moscow Historical Club, which would eventually merge with the Latah County Pioneer Association to form the Latah County Pioneer Historical mMseum Association. As Latah Legacy editor LaNelle McInturff puts it in the 2023 issue of the Legacy (Vol. 45, No. 1):


> Thankfully, the LCPHMA shortened its name to the Latah County Museum Society in 1973. 
> The organization name was officially changed to the Latah County Historical Society in 1978 
> to reflect its wider scope of activities in preserving, sharing and celebrating the history of Latah County,
> in addition to its goal of finding a way to display artifacts telling the areaâ€™s history.

## The Latah Legacy
The Latah Legacy began in 1972 as a quarterly bulletin put out by Latah County Pioneer Historical Museum Association.

Although the first quarterly bulletin consisted primarily of news and updates relating to the organization, the bulletin quickly began to regularly include copies of historical narratives and reviews of books related to Latah County history. 

By 1980, the quarterly newsletter had become a full-fledged journal of local history, the Latah Legacy.

The digital copies of both the newsletter and the journal in this collection serve to track the LCHS' organizational growth from 1972 - 2023 as well as showcase the development of its presentation of local history.
